# Train Ticket Booking Systems
This repository contains the online bus ticket booking system I have built on the course Systems Analysis and Design. It covers implemented use cases such as: 
Account management (account login, account registration, delete account)
Train timetable information (show all stations, show timetable and seats according to search criteria)
Train management (change timetable, add new train, delete train)
Ticket booking (book ticket, payment)
Ticket management (check booked tickets, refund booked tickets)
Look into docs/ for the requirement, analysis, and design documents (in Traditional Chinese).
